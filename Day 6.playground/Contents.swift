//Why are Swiftâ€™s closure parameters inside the braces?

//Returning values from a closure

//How do you return a value from a closure that takes no parameters?

//A closure that accepts a parameter and returns nothing
let payment1 = { (user: String) in
    print("Paying \(user)...")
}

//A closure that accepts a parameter and returns a Boolean value
let payment2 = { (user: String) -> Bool in
    print("Paying \(user)...")
    return true
}

//A closure that returns a value without accepting any parameters
let payment3 = { () -> Bool in
    print("Paying an anonymous person...")
    return true
}

//Closures as parameters

let driving3 = {
    print("I'm driving in my car")

// () -> Void - Swift's way of saying "nothing" - It accepts no parameters and returns Void

func travel(action: () -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")

//Trailing closure syntax

    print("I arrived")
}

travel1() {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
